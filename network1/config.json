Nodes represent artists, color-coded by gender (blue for male, red for female, and yellow for unknown). Edges represent the association between artists and their artistic styles. The visualization reveals significant gender disparities, with male artists dominating the network. Female artists are less connected and underrepresented, particularly in traditionally male-dominated movements like Abstract Expressionism and Surrealism. ",
